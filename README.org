#+title: Common Lisp: Numerical and Scientific Computing - Call for Needs

There are numerous numerical and scientific computing libraries in Common Lisp - the [[https://github.com/CodyReichert/awesome-cl?tab=readme-ov-file#numerical-and-scientific][awesome-cl]] list is given [[id:awesome-cl-list][below]]. And yet, it always feels insufficient.

The following repository is an effort to consolidate the needs of multiple individuals and organizations who are using or want to use Common Lisp to meet their numerical and scientific (numsci) computing needs. To contribute, simply create an [[https://github.com/digikar99/common-lisp-numsci-call-for-needs/issues][issue]] with the following details:

1. What problems or end-goals do you plan to use the numsci ecosystem for? Examples may include: graphics, physics, biology, etc. Try to be specific, but if it's difficult to be specific because, say, you are still in an exploratory phase, that's okay.
2. What current libraries from those listed [[id:awesome-cl-list][below]] are the closest to meeting your needs?
3. What non-lisp libraries and framework do you think are the closest to meeting your needs?
4. Do you think your needs can be met by a thin CFFI wrapper around the foreign libraries? Did you try [[https://github.com/rpav/cl-autowrap][cl-autowrap]]? If you tried cl-autowrap but ran into difficulties, could you describe the issues you faced?
5. What problems do you face while using the lisp numsci libraries, and what is your wish-list for them? When was the last time you wanted to drop Common Lisp in favour of another ecosystem? What made you want to switch, what made you stick?
6. Any other details you wish to provide.

The issues may eventually be consolidated into this README by issuing [[https://github.com/digikar99/common-lisp-numsci-call-for-needs/pulls][Pull requests]]. If you feel the consolidation process can be improved in some way, feel free to create an issue for that too, and tag it as Meta.
